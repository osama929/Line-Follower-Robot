# IR Line Follower Robot

## Description
This project is an **IR Line Follower Robot** built using an Arduino and the Adafruit Motor Shield.
The robot follows a path using infrared sensors and controls its movement through DC motors.
It is designed for educational purposes and robotics enthusiasts who want to learn about autonomous navigation.

## Features
- **IR Sensor-Based Line Detection**: Uses IR sensors to detect and follow a predefined path.
- **Motor Control**: Controls DC motors using the Adafruit Motor Shield.
- **Autonomous Movement**: Moves along a track automatically without user intervention.
- **Easy Customization**: Code can be modified to adjust speed, sensitivity, and behavior.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno (or compatible)
- Adafruit Motor Shield
- IR Sensors (at least 2 for basic functionality)
- DC Motors (2 for differential drive)
- Power Supply (Battery pack)
- Chassis for mounting components

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE (latest version recommended)
- AFMotor Library (for motor control)

## Installation and Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. **Open the Code in Arduino IDE**
   - Load `IRLineFollowerRobot.ino`
3. **Upload to Arduino**
   - Connect your Arduino board to your computer and upload the code.
4. **Run the Robot**
   - Place the robot on a track with a visible line and observe its movement.
   - Adjust sensor positioning or code parameters for better performance.

## File Structure
- `IRLineFollowerRobot.ino` - Main Arduino code that controls the robot.
- `AFMotor.h` - Motor control library header file.
- `AFMotor.cpp` - Motor control library implementation.

## How It Works
1. **Sensor Input**: IR sensors detect the black/white surface.
2. **Decision Making**: Based on sensor data, the code determines movement.
3. **Motor Control**: The appropriate motors are activated to steer the robot.

## Future Improvements
- Implement **PID control** for smoother movement.
- Add an **LCD display** to show real-time sensor data.
- Integrate **Bluetooth/WiFi** for remote control and monitoring.
